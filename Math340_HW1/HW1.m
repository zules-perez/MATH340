% Section 1.1 problem # 5
% Calculates the Nth Taylor Polynomial for f(x) = e^x
% Calls function TaylorsPoly(x,N) 
% couldnt figure out how to input it in interval notation
% and get the answers I was looking for. So I just replace x
% either -1 or 1

x = 1

N = 9;

p = TaylorsPoly(x,N)
 
%%
%Section 1.3 problem # 12

n = 6;

x = 4;

x1 = [1 1 2 3 5 8];

product = VectorProduct(n,x,x1);
